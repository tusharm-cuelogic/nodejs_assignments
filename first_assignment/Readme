Assignment #1: Node.JS Basics

Create a http server which reads username from request parameter and prints
“Hello <username>” on browser.

− it should run as node server.js <port_number> , server will check it port is
already is in use and throw error else it should start the server
− eg: localhost:8000/hello/cuelogic will output “Hello cuelogic”
− For invalid route / url, server should handle it and throw 404 error
